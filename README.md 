# generate_password

This tool generates a random strong password using openssl. The generated password will include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## How it works

When you run the `generate_password.sh` script, it will generate a random password using the `openssl` command. The length of the password is set by the `length` variable in the script, and can be adjusted as needed. The generated password is then displayed on the command line, along with a message that includes the name of the tool and the name of the author.
